# LLM Session Manager
## The First Multi-Session Management Tool for AI Coding Assistants

---

### **The Problem**
Engineering teams now run **5-10+ parallel AI coding sessions** (Claude Code, Cursor) across different features and codebases. But they have:
- ❌ **Zero visibility** into session health
- ❌ **No token tracking** (surprise limit hits mid-workflow)
- ❌ **No context rot detection** (degraded AI responses)

**Result:** 15-20 minutes wasted per token surprise × 3-5 times/day = **$2,000-4,000/engineer/month in lost productivity**

---

### **The Solution**
**LLM Session Manager** is a CLI/TUI tool that treats AI sessions like Docker containers — manageable, monitorable resources.

```bash
$ llm-session monitor    # Real-time dashboard
Active Sessions (3)
┏━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━┓
┃ ID        ┃ Type    ┃  PID ┃ Tokens┃ Health┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━┩
│ claude... │ claude  │28373 │ 24,177│ ✅ 92%│
│ cursor... │ cursor  │29481 │ 32,068│ ⚠️ 68%│
│ claude... │ claude  │30192 │ 15,443│ ✅ 95%│
└───────────┴─────────┴──────┴───────┴───────┘

💡 cursor... nearing token limit - consider restarting
```

---

### **Key Features**
1. **Auto-Discovery** - Finds all Claude/Cursor processes automatically
2. **Health Scoring** - 4-factor algorithm (tokens 40% + duration 20% + activity 20% + errors 20%)
3. **Token Tracking** - Real-time estimation by scanning project files
4. **Context Export/Import** - Save session state before restarting
5. **Live Dashboard** - Auto-refreshing TUI with keyboard controls

---

### **Why Now?**
- **53%** of developers use Claude Code
- **82%** enterprise adoption of GitHub Copilot
- **$228-468/user/year** spent on AI coding assistants
- **Gartner forecast:** Near-universal adoption by 2028

**Market gap:** No existing tools manage multi-session workflows. We're first.

### **Competitive Advantage**

| Feature | LLM Session Manager | Windsurf | Supermaven | Helicone |
|---------|---------------------|----------|------------|----------|
| Multi-session visibility | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Health scoring | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Token tracking | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ Single | ⚠️ API-level |
| Local-first | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**Bottom line:** We don't enhance single sessions. We manage *multiple* sessions — an entirely new category.

---

### **Traction**
✅ **Fully functional MVP** (Steps 1-8 of 14 complete)
✅ **Open source** (Python 3.10+, MIT license)
✅ **No direct competitors** (novelty score: 8/10)
✅ **5 pilot targets identified** (Elessar, CodeViz, Tara AI, Helicone, Signadot)

---

### **Business Model**

**Pricing:**
- **Free Tier:** Open source, unlimited sessions, local storage
- **Team Tier:** $10/user/month - team dashboard, history, email support
- **Enterprise Tier:** $25/user/month - SSO, analytics, API, dedicated support

**Market sizing:**
- **TAM:** 10M enterprise developers × $120/year = **$1.2B**
- **SAM:** 2M power users × $120/year = **$240M**
- **SOM (Year 3):** 25,000 users = **$3M ARR**

---

### **Pilot Program** 🚀
**We're looking for 3-5 companies:**
- **Free for 3 months** (normally $10/user/month)
- **5-20 engineers** using Claude Code or Cursor
- **Weekly check-ins** to gather feedback
- **Optional case study** if you see results

**Commitment:** 30-min onboarding + 15-min weekly calls

---

### **Use Cases**

**Use Case 1: Token Limit Prevention**
Engineer at 85% token usage doesn't realize it, hits limit mid-explanation. Loses 15 minutes.
→ **With LLM Session Manager:** Dashboard shows "⚠️ 72%" warning. Engineer exports context, restarts proactively. Zero downtime.

**Use Case 2: Context Rot Detection**
Session running for 6 hours, AI responses degrading. Engineer wastes 30 minutes on bad suggestions.
→ **With LLM Session Manager:** Health score drops to 58%. Engineer sees warning, restarts. Quality restored immediately.

**Use Case 3: Multi-Session Orchestration**
Engineer has 8 sessions across 3 features. Forgets which is which. Asks wrong session for help.
→ **With LLM Session Manager:** Dashboard shows all 8 with working directories, durations, tokens. Switch to correct session immediately.

---

### **Technical Stack**
- **Python 3.10+** with Poetry
- **Rich + Typer** for terminal UI/CLI
- **psutil** for process discovery
- **SQLite** for local storage
- **structlog** for logging

**Key algorithms:**
- Token estimation: Base + messages + files (~4 chars/token)
- Health scoring: Weighted formula with 4 components
- Caching: mtime-based for performance

---

### **Roadmap**

**✅ Completed (v0.1.0):**
Session discovery, token estimation, health monitoring, dashboard, CLI

**🚧 In Progress:**
Context enhancements, cross-session memory, configuration

**📅 Upcoming (Q2-Q3 2025):**
Team dashboard, VS Code extension, GitHub Copilot support, integrations
