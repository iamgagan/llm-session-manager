## üìÖ Week 1: Create Viral Content Assets

### **Day 1-2: Record Demo Video (CRITICAL)**

**Why it matters:** Videos get 10√ó more engagement than text

**What to create:**
1. **30-second teaser** (Twitter/X, LinkedIn)
2. **2-minute demo** (Show HN, Product Hunt)
3. **5-minute walkthrough** (YouTube, README)

**Script for 30-second viral clip:**
```
[Screen recording showing cluttered terminal with 8 Claude sessions]

"I have 8 Claude Code sessions open right now.

Which one is about to hit the token limit?

Which one has context rot?

I have no idea.

So I built this."

[Show `llm-session monitor` command]
[Dashboard appears showing all sessions with health scores]

"LLM Session Manager.
Open source.
github.com/iamgagan/llm-session-manager"
```

**Tools:**
- Loom (free, easy)
- QuickTime + iMovie (Mac native)
- OBS Studio (professional, free)

**Post to:**
- Twitter/X (native video gets 2√ó more views than YouTube links)
- LinkedIn (videos auto-play in feed)
- Reddit (v.redd.it uploads work best)

---

### **Day 3: Create Shareable Screenshots**

**What to create:**
1. **"Before/After" comparison**
   - Before: 10 messy terminal windows
   - After: Clean dashboard with all sessions visible

2. **"Problem/Solution" visual**
   - Problem: "Just hit my token limit for the 3rd time today"
   - Solution: Screenshot of health warning at 85%

3. **"Feature showcase" carousel** (for Twitter/LinkedIn)
   - Slide 1: Session discovery
   - Slide 2: Health monitoring
   - Slide 3: Token tracking
   - Slide 4: Export/import

**Tools:**

**Title options (test A/B):**
1. "I Hit Claude's Token Limit 5 Times Today, So I Built This"
2. "The Hidden Cost of AI Coding: $2,000/Month in Wasted Token Limits"
3. "Managing 10 AI Coding Sessions is Impossible. Here's Why."

**Structure (1,500 words):**
1. **Hook** (100 words)
   - Start with relatable pain: "It's 11pm. I'm explaining a complex bug to Claude for the third time because I hit the token limit mid-sentence."

2. **The Problem** (300 words)
   - Show the math: 3-5 token surprises/day √ó 15 min each = 1.25 hours wasted
   - Quote from frustrated developer (you)
   - Screenshots of the chaos

3. **The Solution** (400 words)
   - "I built a CLI tool in a weekend"
   - Show the dashboard screenshot
   - Explain the 4-factor health scoring

4. **How It Works** (400 words)
   - Session discovery with psutil
   - Token estimation algorithm
   - Health monitoring logic

## üìÖ Week 2: Launch on High-Traffic Platforms

### **Launch #1: Show HN (Tuesday/Wednesday 9-11am PT)**

**Why Show HN:**
- 500K+ monthly visitors
- Developer audience
- High-quality traffic
- Top posts get 10K+ views

**How to maximize:**

**Title format:**
> "Show HN: I built a CLI to manage my 10 Claude Code sessions"

**Post content (500 words max):**
```
Hi HN,

I've been using Claude Code heavily for the past 6 months. My workflow:
open 5-10 sessions for different features, bugs, and experiments.

The problem: I kept hitting token limits mid-explanation, losing context,
and wasting 15-20 minutes re-explaining. No way to know which session
was about to die.

So I built LLM Session Manager.

It's a CLI tool that:
- Auto-discovers Claude Code and Cursor sessions
- Tracks token usage with file scanning
- Calculates health scores (tokens 40% + duration 20% + activity 20% + errors 20%)
- Shows a live dashboard (like `htop` but for AI sessions)

Demo: [Loom video link]
GitHub: https://github.com/iamgagan/llm-session-manager

Tech stack: Python 3.10+, Rich (TUI), psutil, SQLite. MIT licensed.

I've been dogfooding it for a week. Zero token surprises. Saves me
~30 minutes/day.

Would love feedback on:
1. Is this a problem you face?
2. What features would make this indispensable?
3. Should I build GitHub Copilot support?

Thanks!
```

**Timing:**
- Post Tuesday or Wednesday
- Between 9-11am Pacific Time
- Avoid Mondays (lower traffic)
- Avoid Fridays (people check out early)

**Engagement strategy:**
- Respond to EVERY comment within 30 minutes
- Be humble, grateful, curious
- Ask follow-up questions
- Share technical details when asked
- Upvote thoughtful comments

**Success metrics:**
- 100+ points = viral success
- 50-100 points = solid launch
- 10-50 points = decent exposure

---

### **Launch #2: Product Hunt (Thursday for Friday Feature)**

**Why Product Hunt:**
- 5M+ monthly visitors
- Great for tools/SaaS
- #1 Product of the Day = 5K+ visitors

**How to prepare:**

**1. Create compelling listing:**
- **Tagline:** "htop for your AI coding sessions"
- **Description:**
  > "LLM Session Manager helps developers track and manage multiple Claude Code and Cursor sessions with real-time health monitoring and token tracking. Never hit a token limit unexpectedly again."

**2. Upload media:**
- Thumbnail: Dashboard screenshot
- Gallery: 3-4 screenshots showing key features
- Demo video: Your 2-minute video

**3. Build "hunter" network:**
- Ask 5-10 developer friends to upvote
- Post in relevant Slack/Discord communities
- Share on Twitter with #ProductHunt

**4. First comment strategy:**
Write a detailed first comment explaining:
- The problem you faced
- How you built it
- What's next on the roadmap
- Ask for feedback

**Example:**
```
Hey Product Hunt! üëã

I built this because I was hitting Claude's token limit 3-5 times
per day while coding. Each time = 15-20 min of re-explaining context.

LLM Session Manager is like `htop` but for AI coding sessions. It
shows you which sessions are healthy, which are about to hit limits,
and which have "context rot."

Built with Python, Rich (for the TUI), and psutil. Took a weekend
to build, been using it for a week.

What feature should I add next?
1. GitHub Copilot support
2. Team dashboard (shared session view)
3. Session collaboration (share contexts)

GitHub: https://github.com/iamgagan/llm-session-manager
```

**Timing:**
- Submit Thursday afternoon (PST)
- Gets featured Friday morning
- Engage heavily Friday 6am-12pm PST

---

- Lead with the problem, not the solution
- Use conversational tone
- Include demo GIF (Reddit loves GIFs)
- Respond to every comment
- Post at 9-11am EST or 6-8pm EST (peak times)

**DON'T:**
- Spam multiple subreddits same day (space out by 2-3 days)
- Use salesy language
- Ignore criticism
- Delete negative comments

**Example post for r/ClaudeAI:**
```
Title: I hit Claude's token limit 5 times today, so I built this

Body:
Does anyone else have like 8 Claude Code sessions open at once?

I do this constantly:
- Session 1: Refactoring auth
- Session 2: Debugging API
- Session 3: Writing tests
- Session 4: Exploring new feature
- Sessions 5-8: Forgot what these are for

Problem: I hit the token limit mid-explanation at least 3-5
times per day. Zero warning. Just "sorry, you've reached your limit."

So I built a CLI tool that monitors all your sessions and shows
you which ones are about to die.

[Demo GIF showing dashboard]

It's open source (MIT license):
https://github.com/iamgagan/llm-session-manager

Features:
- Auto-discovers Claude Code sessions
- Tracks token usage
- Health scores (warns you at 70%)
- Export/import contexts

Built it in a weekend with Python. Been using it for a week.
Zero token surprises since.

What do you think? Worth using?
```

### **LinkedIn Strategy**

**Goal:** 5K impressions, professional credibility

**Post types:**

**Post 1: Personal story**
```
I wasted 2 hours this week re-explaining context to Claude Code
because I hit token limits.

So I built a tool to fix it.

LLM Session Manager: Open-source CLI for managing multiple AI
coding sessions.

[Professional screenshot]

Tech leads: Is this a problem your team faces?

GitHub: [link]

#AI #SoftwareDevelopment #OpenSource
```

**Post 2: Case study**
```
Building AI tools requires AI assistance.

But managing 10+ AI coding sessions is impossible without visibility.

I built LLM Session Manager to solve this:

Before: 3-5 token limit surprises per day
After: Zero surprises, 30 min/day saved

Open sourced last week. 100+ stars.

[Dashboard screenshot]

Link in comments.

#ArtificialIntelligence #DeveloperTools
```

**Post 3: Technical leadership**
```
As AI coding assistants become standard, we need new tooling
for a new workflow.

LLM Session Manager addresses a gap: multi-session orchestration.

Like Docker for AI contexts.

Key learnings from building it:
1. Token limits are the new bottleneck
2. Context rot is a real UX problem
3. Developers need visibility, not automation

Open source, MIT licensed.

## üî• The "Nuclear Option" (If Nothing Else Works)

### **Controversial Takes (Use Sparingly)**

**Provocative tweets:**
```
Hot take: AI coding assistants are useless if you keep hitting
token limits mid-flow.

I hit the limit 5√ó today. Built a tool to fix it.

[link]
```

```
Unpopular opinion: Claude Code needs better session management.

Not better AI. Better infrastructure.

Built it myself: [link]
```

**Comparison posts:**
```
Everyone's arguing about Claude vs Cursor vs Copilot.

Meanwhile, I'm over here managing 10 sessions of all three
with zero visibility.

Fixed it: [link]
```

**Why this works:**
- Controversial = engagement
- Engagement = algorithm boost
- Algorithm boost = reach

**Warning:**
- Can backfire if too aggressive
- May alienate some people
- Use only if organic growth stalls
