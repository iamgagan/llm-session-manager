# LLM Session Manager - Product Brief

## One-Line Pitch
**The first CLI tool to manage multiple AI coding sessions with real-time health monitoring and token tracking.**

---

## The Problem (30 seconds)

Engineering teams now run **5-10+ parallel AI coding sessions** (Claude Code, Cursor) across different features, bugs, and codebases. But they have:

- ❌ **Zero visibility** into which sessions are healthy vs. degraded
- ❌ **No token tracking** across sessions (surprise limit hits mid-workflow)
- ❌ **No way to detect "context rot"** (when AI responses degrade)
- ❌ **Wasted spend** on degraded sessions that produce poor output

**Result:** 15-20 minutes wasted per token limit surprise × 3-5 times per day per engineer = **$2,000-4,000/engineer/month in lost productivity.**

---

## The Solution (30 seconds)

**LLM Session Manager** is an open-source CLI/TUI tool that treats AI coding sessions like Docker containers — manageable, monitorable resources.

### Core Features:
1. **Session Discovery** - Auto-finds all running Claude/Cursor processes
2. **Real-time Dashboard** - Live TUI showing health, tokens, duration, activity
3. **Health Scoring** - Multi-factor algorithm (token usage 40% + duration 20% + activity 20% + errors 20%)
4. **Token Tracking** - Estimates token usage by scanning project files with caching
5. **Context Export/Import** - Save and restore session contexts before restarting

### CLI Commands:
```bash
llm-session list              # Show all sessions (table or JSON)
llm-session monitor           # Real-time dashboard with auto-refresh
llm-session health <id>       # Detailed health breakdown
llm-session export <id>       # Save session context to JSON
llm-session import-context    # Restore session from JSON
```

## Key Differentiators

| Feature | LLM Session Manager | Competitors |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Multi-session visibility** | ✅ Core feature | ❌ None |
| **Health scoring** | ✅ 4-factor weighted | ❌ Not available |
| **Token tracking** | ✅ Per-session estimates | ⚠️ API-level only |
| **Context rot detection** | ✅ Duration + idle monitoring | ❌ Not tracked |
| **Local-first** | ✅ No cloud required | ⚠️ Most are SaaS |
| **CLI-native** | ✅ Terminal users love it | ⚠️ Web dashboards |

**Bottom line:** We're not enhancing single sessions (Windsurf, Supermaven). We're managing *multiple* sessions — an entirely new category.

---

## Market Opportunity

### Current State:
- **53%** of developers use Claude Code
- **82%** enterprise adoption of GitHub Copilot
- **$228-468/user/year** spent on AI coding assistants
- **Gartner forecast:** Near-universal enterprise adoption by 2028

### Our Positioning:
- **Price:** $10/user/month (5-10× cheaper than AI assistants)
- **Value Prop:** Maximize AI assistant ROI by preventing wasted sessions
- **TAM:** 10M enterprise developers × $120/year = **$1.2B market**
- **SAM:** 2M power users × $120/year = **$240M market**

---

## Traction & Validation

### Technical Validation:
- ✅ **Steps 1-8 of 14 complete** (fully functional MVP)
- ✅ **Tested on real systems** (discovers sessions, tracks tokens, calculates health)
- ✅ **Open source** (Python 3.10+, Poetry, Rich/Typer/psutil)
- ✅ **Automated test suite** (14+ tests, comprehensive documentation)

### Market Validation:
- ✅ **No direct competitors** (novelty score: 8/10)
- ✅ **5 pilot targets identified** (Elessar, CodeViz, Tara AI, Helicone, Signadot)
- ✅ **Clear pain point** (enterprise teams running 5-10+ sessions with no visibility)
- ✅ **Perfect timing** (AI adoption curve hitting critical mass)

```

### Health Detail:
```bash
$ llm-session health cursor_4567

Session Health: ⚠️ 68% (Warning)

Component Breakdown:
  Token Usage:    85% of limit  →  Score: 60%  (Weight: 40%)
  Duration:       45 minutes    →  Score: 85%  (Weight: 20%)
  Activity:       2 min idle    →  Score: 95%  (Weight: 20%)
  Error Count:    0 errors      →  Score: 100% (Weight: 20%)

Recommendations:
  ⚠️ High token usage detected
  💡 Consider exporting context and restarting session
  💡 Estimated tokens remaining: ~30,000 (15% of limit)
```

---

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: "Token Limit Surprise Prevention"
**Before:** Engineer at 85% token usage, doesn't realize it, hits limit mid-feature explanation. Loses 15 minutes restarting.

**After:** Dashboard shows "⚠️ 72% health" warning. Engineer exports context, restarts session proactively. Zero downtime.

---

### Use Case 2: "Context Rot Detection"
**Before:** Session running for 6 hours, AI responses getting weird. Engineer doesn't realize context has degraded. Wastes 30 minutes on bad suggestions.

**After:** Health score drops to 58% due to duration. Engineer sees warning, restarts session with fresh context. Quality restored immediately.

---

### Use Case 3: "Multi-Session Orchestration"
**Before:** Engineer has 8 sessions open across 3 features. Forgets which session is working on what. Accidentally asks wrong session for help.

**After:** Dashboard shows all 8 sessions with working directories, durations, token counts. Engineer switches to correct session immediately.

## Appendix: FAQ

**Q: Does this slow down my AI coding sessions?**
A: No. Monitoring runs in a separate process. Token estimation is cached (only re-scans modified files).

**Q: What if I use multiple AI assistants (Claude + Cursor)?**
A: Perfect use case! The dashboard shows all sessions across all assistants in one view.

**Q: Can I use this with GitHub Copilot?**
A: Not yet. Currently supports Claude Code and Cursor. Copilot support is on the roadmap.

**Q: Is my code sent anywhere?**
A: No. 100% local. No telemetry, no cloud dependency. All data stays on your machine.

**Q: What platforms are supported?**
A: macOS and Linux (Unix-based). Windows support planned for Q3 2025.

**Q: Can I contribute features?**
A: Absolutely! It's open source. PRs welcome. Pilot companies get priority on roadmap decisions.
