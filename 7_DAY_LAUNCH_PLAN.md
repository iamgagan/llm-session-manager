Hi Product Hunt! üëã

I built LLM Session Manager after realizing I had zero
visibility into my AI coding sessions. I'd hit token limits
unexpectedly, lose context, and start over. Frustrating!

This tool solves that:

üîç Auto-Discovery
Finds Claude Code, Cursor, and Copilot sessions automatically

üìä Token Tracking
Real-time token counting so you never hit limits unexpectedly

‚ù§Ô∏è Health Monitoring
Multi-factor health scores with recommendations

üë• Team Collaboration
Real-time chat, presence, and cursor tracking for teams

üß† AI Insights (Pro)
Smart recommendations powered by Cognee AI

It's open source (core CLI) with a Pro tier for AI features.

Would love your feedback!

GitHub: https://github.com/yourusername/llm-session-manager
Demo: [video link]
```

**Topics:**
- Developer Tools
- AI
- Productivity
- Open Source
- Monitoring

**First Comment (Prepare):**
```
Hi everyone! üëã I'm the maker.

I built this because I kept losing work when hitting token
limits in Claude Code. Now I can see token usage in real-time
and get AI-powered recommendations on when to start fresh.

It works with:
- Claude Code
- Cursor
- GitHub Copilot

The core CLI is free and open source. There's a Pro tier
($29/mo) for AI insights and team collaboration.

AMA! Happy to answer questions and get feedback.

P.S. Install in 30 seconds:
curl -fsSL [setup.sh URL] | bash
```
