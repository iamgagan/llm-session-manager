## 🚀 After Moving to Notion

**Delete from GitHub:**
```bash
git rm VIRAL_STRATEGY.md
git rm UPGRADE_ROADMAP.md
git rm WHATS_NEW_v0.2.0.md
git rm FEATURES_COMPLETED.md
git rm DASHBOARD_FEATURES.md
git rm TESTING_SUMMARY.md
git rm QUICK_TEST.md

## 📝 Quick Copy Guide

For each file, you can:

1. **Create Notion page** with the same title
2. **Copy content** from markdown file
3. **Format** using Notion's markdown import or paste directly
4. **Add to** appropriate folder in Notion hierarchy

Notion supports markdown, so most formatting will transfer automatically.
