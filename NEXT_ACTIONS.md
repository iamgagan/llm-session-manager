## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. **Perfectionism**
**Pitfall:** Waiting for the "perfect" product before launching
**Solution:** Ship now with v0.1.0, iterate based on pilot feedback

### 2. **Targeting Too Broad**
**Pitfall:** Trying to appeal to all developers
**Solution:** Focus on power users with 5+ sessions (see `MARKET_ANALYSIS.md`)

### 3. **Ignoring Feedback**
**Pitfall:** Building features you think are cool, not what users need
**Solution:** Weekly check-ins with pilots, prioritize by frequency of requests

### 4. **Over-Engineering**
**Pitfall:** Adding too many features before validating core value
**Solution:** Stick to Steps 1-8 until pilots validate, then build Steps 9-14

### 5. **Poor Communication**
**Pitfall:** Long response times to pilot companies
**Solution:** Commit to < 2 hour response time during pilots (set expectations)

---

- **Days 15-30:** Support pilot, collect feedback, iterate

**One Action to Start Right Now:**

```bash
# Create GitHub repo and push code
cd /Users/gagan/llm-session-manager
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial release: LLM Session Manager v0.1.0"
