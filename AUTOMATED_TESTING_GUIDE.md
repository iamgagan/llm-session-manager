# 🤖 Automated Testing Guide - Super Simple!

**You're right! Manual testing is tedious. Let's automate everything!**

---

## ⚡ ONE-COMMAND TESTING

### Run All Tests Automatically:

```bash
./run_all_tests.sh
```

**That's it!** The script will:
- ✅ Test all CLI commands (30+)
- ✅ Test backend API (if running)
- ✅ Test installation files
- ✅ Test documentation
- ✅ Generate detailed report
- ✅ Tell you if ready to launch!

---

## 📊 What Gets Tested

### CLI Tests (Automated)
```
✅ Session Discovery - Does it find sessions?
✅ Token Tracking - Is it accurate?
✅ Health Monitoring - Does it calculate scores?
✅ Export (JSON/YAML/MD) - Can it export?
✅ Memory Commands - Add, search, list working?
✅ Tagging - Can add/remove tags?
✅ Info Command - Shows version info?
✅ Init Command - Setup wizard works?
```

### Backend Tests (Automated - if backend running)
```
✅ Health Endpoint - Is backend alive?
✅ API Documentation - Swagger UI accessible?
✅ CORS Headers - Configured correctly?
✅ Response Times - Fast enough (<500ms)?
✅ Session Endpoints - APIs working?
```

### Critical Files (Automated)
```
✅ setup.sh - Installation script exists?
✅ docker-compose.yml - Container config exists?
✅ README.md - Documentation exists?
✅ pyproject.toml - Python config exists?
```

## 💡 Why Automated Testing?

**Before (Manual):**
- ❌ Test 30 commands manually (2 hours)
- ❌ Easy to miss things
- ❌ Boring and tedious
- ❌ Have to repeat every time

**After (Automated):**
- ✅ Run one command (2 minutes)
- ✅ Tests everything systematically
- ✅ Generates detailed report
- ✅ Run anytime, instantly

---

## 🐛 If Tests Fail

### Check the report:
```bash
cat test_results_cli.json
```

### Example:
```json
{
  "name": "Export - JSON",
  "status": "FAIL",
  "error": "File permission denied"
}
```

### Fix it:
```bash
chmod 755 /tmp
# Run tests again
./run_all_tests.sh
```

## 🎉 Ready to Launch?

If you see this:
```
🎉 ALL TESTS PASSED! READY TO LAUNCH! 🚀
Success Rate: 100%
```

**You're good to go!**

Next steps:
1. Check [7_DAY_LAUNCH_PLAN.md](7_DAY_LAUNCH_PLAN.md)
2. Proceed to Wednesday's tasks
3. Launch on Sunday! 🚀

## 📞 Quick Help

**Tests won't run?**
```bash
# Make sure you're in project root
cd /Users/gagan/llm-session-manager

# Make test script executable
chmod +x run_all_tests.sh

# Run again
./run_all_tests.sh
```

**Backend tests failing?**
```bash
# Start backend first
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Then run tests in another terminal
./run_all_tests.sh
```

**Python errors?**
```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run tests
./run_all_tests.sh
```
