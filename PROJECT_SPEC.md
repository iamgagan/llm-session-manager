# LLM Context Session Manager - Technical Specification

## Project Overview
Build a CLI tool that tracks and manages multiple parallel LLM coding sessions (Claude Code, Cursor CLI, etc.), providing real-time visibility into session health, token usage, and intelligent context management.

## Problem Statement
Developers using AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor) struggle with:
- Managing 5-10+ parallel sessions across multiple terminal windows
- No visibility into which sessions need attention
- Context degradation ("context rot") as conversations grow
- Sessions operating in isolation with no shared knowledge
- Manual token tracking and session management

## Solution
A Python-based CLI tool with a TUI (Terminal User Interface) that:
1. Auto-discovers active LLM sessions
2. Monitors session health and token usage in real-time
3. Provides a dashboard view of all sessions
4. Enables context export/import between sessions
5. Offers cross-session memory/knowledge sharing
